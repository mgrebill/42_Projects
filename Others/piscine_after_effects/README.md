# Piscine After Effects
In 42, we have an association called studio42, directed by 30_1, a nice member
of the staff. This wonderful association record and manage all conferences and
events in 42. One day, 30_1 decided to create the "Creation Cursus". First
project in this cursus : The After Effects Piscine. A one week stage to learn
how to use after effects. I loved it, it was an amazing week. In this directory
you'll find the .aep files, that can only be opened with After Effects. If you
want to see the videos, go to my youtube channel and watch [this
playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3LNBMZjVz9fBxHJaCWpPbk5_UaMAdS2C).

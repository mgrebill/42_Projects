# Basic_Projects
Every 42 students has to complete this projects before chosing a branch.<br />
<br />
## Libft
This project consist in recreating basic functions of the libc, useful functions
defined by 42 (chained lists, additional functions for str and mem...) and
bonuses functions that we find useful. This lib will be useful in almost every
projects in 42.<br />
<br />
## Fillit
You have a list of tetriminos and your algorithm has to find how it can be
agenced in the smallest square possible. This project is made to learn us
backtracking algorithms.<br />
<br />
## Get_Next_Line
Because reading on a file descriptor character by character is easy, but not
line by line. I had to make a function that store in a string a line of a file.
If the function is called again, the next line will be stored, etc... Bonuses
are : use only one static variable and handle multiple file descriptors.<br />
<br />
<br />
After those projects, i had to chose a branch. There is 3 branches :
- Unix / System
- Algorithms
- Graphics<br />
I chose Algorithmic branch, so see you in the corresponded directory ;)
